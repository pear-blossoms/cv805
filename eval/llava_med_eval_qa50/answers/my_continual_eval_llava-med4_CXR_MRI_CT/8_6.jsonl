These cells appear as small, round structures with a darker center, representing the nucleus, and a lighter surrounding area, representing the cytoplasm. The CD3+ T cells are densely packed and distributed throughout the portal tracts.\n\nPanel b, magnified at 100x, displays scattered PAX8+ B cells within the portal tracts. These cells are also round in shape but are less densely distributed compared to the CD3+ T cells. The PAX8+ B cells are interspersed among other cell types within the tissue.\n\nPanel c, magnified at 600x, highlights the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells throughout the portal and periportal areas. These cells are large, with a distinctive bilobed nucleus and prominent nucleoli, giving them an \"owl's eye\" appearance. The surrounding tissue contains a mix of other cell types.\n\nPanel d, also magnified at 600x, shows the Reed-Sternberg cells positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) using Epstein-Barr encoding region in situ hybridization. The positive cells exhibit a specific staining pattern, indicating the presence of EBV within the cells.\n\nPanel e, magnified at 600x, demonstrates the Reed-Sternberg cells positive for CD15. The positive cells exhibit a distinct staining pattern, highlighting the expression of the CD15 marker on the cell surface.\n\nFinally, panel f, magnified at 600x, reveals the Reed-Sternberg cells positive for CD30. Similar to the previous panels, the positive cells display a unique staining pattern, indicating the expression of the CD30 marker on the cell surface.\n\nOverall, the image provides a comprehensive view of the cellular composition within the portal tracts, highlighting the presence of CD3+ T cells, PAX8+ B cells, and Reed-Sternberg cells positive for EBV, CD15, and CD30.", "model_id": "llava-med4_CXR_MRI_CT", "metadata": {}}

It consists of several panels, each showcasing different aspects of the experiment.\n\nIn the first panel, Doppler images depict blood flow in the femoral arteries of two groups of mice: wild-type (WT) and BLTR1-deficient (KO) mice, four weeks after wire injury (WI). The images are color-coded, with red hues indicating regions of maximum perfusion, yellow representing medium perfusion values, and blue signifying the lowest perfusion values. Arrows within the images point to the blood flow in the injured femoral arteries.\n\nThe second panel presents cross-sections of mouse femoral arteries stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) at four weeks after WI. These images provide a clear view of the arterial structure and the neointima formation in the injured arteries.\n\nIn the third panel, the neointima is stained with anti-HMGB1 and anti-CD36 antibodies to visualize HMGB1 and macrophage infiltration, respectively. These images highlight the presence and distribution of these molecules within the neointima area.\n\nThe fourth panel shows vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) stained with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody, providing a visual representation of the VSMCs within the arterial structure.\n\nAt the bottom of the image, there are quantifications of various parameters. These include the LDPI ratio, which is calculated as the ratio of blue-to-red pixels in the injured artery (WI) versus non-injured arteries (Control), neointima volumes in the cross-sections of injured femoral arteries, and the numbers of HMGB1-positive and CD36-positive cells in the neointima area. The data are presented as means \u00b1 SEMs, and statistical significance is indicated with asterisks.\n\nOverall, the image provides a detailed and informative visual representation of the role of BLTR1 in macrophage infiltration and neointima formation in wire-injured femoral arteries, with multiple panels illustrating different aspects of the experiment and quantifications to support the findings.", "model_id": "llava-med4_CXR_MRI_CT", "metadata": {}}
