PET/CT is often used to detect and monitor cancer, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of cancer treatments.\n\nDCE-MRI (Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a specialized form of MRI that involves the injection of a contrast agent into the bloodstream.

Weak or no correlation suggests that there is little or no relationship between the two metrics.\n\nUnderstanding these correlations can help researchers and clinicians make more informed decisions about patient care, such as selecting the most appropriate imaging techniques for monitoring disease progression or evaluating the effectiveness of treatments.
