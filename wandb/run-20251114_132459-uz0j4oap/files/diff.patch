By examining the strength and direction of these correlations, researchers can identify potential associations between the imaging metrics and various aspects of the disease, such as tumor growth, response to treatment, or disease progression.\n\nA strong positive correlation between two metrics suggests that they tend to increase or decrease together, while a strong negative correlation indicates that one metric tends to increase as the other decreases. Weak or no correlation suggests that there is little or no relationship between the two metrics.\n\nUnderstanding these correlations can help researchers and clinicians make more informed decisions about patient care, such as selecting the most appropriate imaging techniques for monitoring disease progression or evaluating the effectiveness of treatments. Additionally, the correlations can provide insights into the underlying biological processes and mechanisms involved in the disease, which may contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies.", "model_id": "llava-med_CT", "metadata": {}}

However, there are noticeable differences between the Winnie and wild-type mice.\n\nIn the Winnie mice, the goblet cells appear to be fewer in number and have smaller thecae, which are the storage compartments for mucin. The reduced size of the thecae is evident by the diminished Alcian blue staining in these areas. Additionally, there are accumulations within the Winnie goblet cells that are PAS-positive and Alcian blue-negative, indicated by arrows in the image. These accumulations suggest the presence of a different material in the cytoplasm of the goblet cells in Winnie mice compared to the wild-type mice.\n\nIn contrast, the wild-type C57BL/6 mice display a more typical histological phenotype, with a higher number of goblet cells and larger thecae. The Alcian blue staining is more prominent in these cells, indicating a greater amount of stored mucin.

The medulla appears to be intact and separate from the mass, indicating that the mass has not infiltrated or affected this area. The surrounding tissues and organs, such as the lungs and the diaphragm, can also be seen in the image, providing context for the location of the mass.\n\nOverall, the image provides a detailed view of the mass and its relationship to the eighth rib and the medulla, allowing for a better understanding of the patient's condition.", "model_id": "llava-med_CT_CXR_Histopathology_MRI", "metadata": {}}

It is a high-resolution, grayscale image that showcases the intricate details of the patient's brain anatomy. The MRI scan was performed using a 3T Siemens Skyra MR scanner at a university medical center.\n\nIn the image, various brain structures can be observed, such as the cerebral cortex, white matter, and deep brain nuclei. The contrast between different tissue types is evident, allowing for a clear distinction between gray and white matter. The image also highlights any potential abnormalities or changes in the brain structure that may be associated with Parkinson's disease.\n\nOverall, the image provides valuable insights into the brain's anatomy and the potential effects of Parkinson's disease on the patient's brain.", "model_id": "llava-med_CT_CXR_Histopathology_MRI", "metadata": {}}

-
-Then download the training files from this link:  
-https://huggingface.co/datasets/leo20000306/CRAG_trainjson
-
-## Next Steps: Training
-
-After downloading the datasets, please follow these steps to start fine-tuning on KANT dataset:
-
-1. Open the script file located at `scripts/v1_5/finetune_newdomain.sh`.
-
-2. Modify the `image_folder` parameter inside that script to point to the local path where your images are stored.
-
-3. Run the training script:
-
-   ```bash
-   bash scripts/v1_5/finetune_newdomain.sh
-   ```
-## Evaluation
-
-To run evaluation, please follow the steps below:
-
-1. Download the test file from this link:  
-   https://huggingface.co/datasets/leo20000306/crag_evaldata
-
-2. In the scripts under `scripts/v1_5/eval/`, modify the relevant files to set:
-
-   - `--question-file` → path to the downloaded test file  
-   - `--image-folder` → path to the folder with the images for evaluation
-
-3. Configure the evaluation script `llava/eval/eval_video_qa.py`:
-
-   - Set your **OpenAI key**  
-   - Set the **base URL** for the OpenAI API (used for scoring model predictions vs labels)
-
-4. Once everything is set up, run the evaluation shell script:
-
-   ```bash
-   bash scripts/v1_5/eval/xxx.sh
